# ball-catcher
This is my first game project, a basic ball catching game made with `pygame`. It has a scoring system. This project is open for suggestions and improvements. Suggestions and improvements are welcome for this project. I'm not a professional developer; I'm simply having fun.

```
pip install pygame
```
